This mod adds a new component to the Time Control HUD in the upper left-hand corner of the screen showing the current year, day of the year (1-8), UTC time and current season as an icon.

[b]NOT SURE HOW TO INSTALL MODS?[/b] It's easy, you can check out a walk-through here: [url=https://wiki.playsapiens.com/index.php/Guide:Mod_Installation] Sapiens Mod Installation Guide[/url]

[h2]Overview[/h2]
First a brief explanation of how time progression works in Sapiens.  Each game year is divided into 4 seasons, with each season having a duration of 2 game days, meaning a game year is 8 game days.  The new control provides the current year, the current day of the year (day 1-8), world time, as well as a graphical representation of the season. 

When you begin a game, you will not necessarily start on day 1 as there are many factors that are considered: where on the globe you start, time passed once you have selected your world, time of day at the location you start a new world, and others.  The exact spot on the original sundial that a game day changes will be based on the clock marker position when you first started playing a newly generated world.  However the day will change at 00:00 UTC on the mod's digital clock, it just won't line up on the sundial to midnight.

[h2]Seasons[/h2]

An Apple Tree is used as the season icon and will change based on the current season.
[h3]Spring[/h3] - Pink blooms on the apple tree.
[h3]Summer[/h3] - Green leaves.
[h3]Autumn[/h3] - Leaves are beginning to yellow.
[h3]Winter[/h3] - No leaves.

The season indicated by the icon is based only on the day of the year it is, so it is a meteorological season determination.  The Sapiens game is built on a planet renderer and the climate model is quite sophisticated.  Much like real life the plant foliage and ground cover will change gradually as you approach seasonal boundaries - it is not a dramatic landscape change at the precise time the season changes.
